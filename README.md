# Lamhe: A Basic Web Application for Converting Photos to Videos with Background Audio

**Lamhe** is a web application designed to transform photos into videos by adding background audio. This project was developed as part of the course "Introduction to Software Systems" by **Rohan**, **Himank**, and **Akmal**.

## Key Features
- **Framework:** Built with Flask.
- **Video Processing:** Utilizes the MoviePy module to convert images into video.
- **Database:** Uses PostgreSQL to store user data and provide authentication.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the git repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Step 2: Install Required Modules
Navigate to the project directory and install all necessary modules:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure the Database Connection

#### For Local Development:
1. Open `app.py`.
2. **Comment out** the section for Render connection:
   ```python
   # db connection for render
   def get_db_connection():
       # Decode the base64 certificate
       cert_decoded = base64.b64decode(os.environ['ROOT_CERT_BASE64'])

       # Define the path to save the certificate
       cert_path = '/opt/render/.postgresql/root.crt'
       os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(cert_path), exist_ok=True)

       # Write the certificate to the file
       with open(cert_path, 'wb') as cert_file:
           cert_file.write(cert_decoded)

       # Set up the connection string with the path to the certificate
       conn = psycopg2.connect(
           "host=stream-strider-4060.7s5.aws-ap-south-1.cockroachlabs.cloud "
           "port=26257 dbname=defaultdb user=akmalali59855_gmail_ "
           "password=J-3IiGnvZtnFfRZ1CVKh_g sslmode=verify-full "
           f"sslrootcert={cert_path}"
       )
       return conn
   ```

3. **Uncomment** the section for localhost connection:
   ```python
   # db connection for local host
   def get_db_connection():
       conn = psycopg2.connect("postgresql://akmalali59855_gmail_:J-3IiGnvZtnFfRZ1CVKh_g@stream-strider-4060.7s5.aws-ap-south-1.cockroachlabs.cloud:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=verify-full")
       return conn
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Application
Run the Flask application using:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

### Step 5: Access the Web Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
